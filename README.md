# MultiPoolMiner
Monitors crypto mining pools in real-time in order to find the most profitable for your machine. Controls any miner that is available via command line. 

In order to make this branch work properly, you have to set **-wallet YOUR-BTC-ADDR** in **start.bat** and also -pool. You can leave -algo unset. Both pools don't work together *yet*.
