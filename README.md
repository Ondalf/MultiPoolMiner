# MultiPoolMiner
Monitors crypto mining pools in real-time in order to find the most profitable for your machine. Controls any miner that is available via command line. 

In order to make this branch work properly, you have to set **-wallet YOUR-BTC-ADDR** in **start.bat** and also -pool. You can leave -algo unset. Both pools don't work together *yet*.

The way I planned this branch to work is that you set diffs, intensities per GPU. This doesn't give anything new or good things for miners, who have single type of GPU in their rigs. This is made for people, like me who doesn't yet own huge farm, but just single machine with random nVidias and want to get the best out of it. 
To clarify my point, 750Ti likes to change algos bit more often, than 1080, and the program shows difference between algo-optimizations for these cards.
